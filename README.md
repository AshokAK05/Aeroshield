# AQ-Drone Project

AQ-drone is an open-source air quality monitoring and prediction system utilizing drone technology to conduct real-time air quality assessments and implement pollution mitigation strategies. The system combines drone flights, air quality sensors, and photocatalytic air purification to provide a scalable and efficient solution for communities affected by pollution.

## About AQ-Drone

Air quality is a major concern in urban areas, especially near industrial sites, highways, and densely populated neighborhoods. AQ-drone helps communities monitor, predict, and mitigate pollution by deploying drones equipped with air quality sensors and TiO2 air purification technology.

### Key Features

- **AI-Guided Navigation**: Drones autonomously navigate to high-pollution areas based on data from local air quality monitoring stations.
- **TiO2 Air Purification**: TiO2-coated plates at ground stations and onboard drones perform photocatalytic purification, reducing harmful pollutants in the air.
- **Real-time Data Collection**: Drones collect air quality metrics including CO, NOx, Ozone, VOCs, and PM, offering real-time insights.
- **Smart Battery Management**: Drones automatically return to stations for recharging when battery levels are low.

## System Workflow

1. **Air Quality Monitoring Stations**: In a city with multiple air quality stations (e.g., Delhi has 116 stations), the system identifies the most polluted station.
2. **Drone Deployment**: The drone is deployed from a station to the most polluted area to collect polluted air and perform on-the-fly air purification using TiO2 plates.
3. **Data Collection and Analysis**: The drone collects air quality data and relays it to the control system.
4. **Return to Station**: The drone returns to its station when the mission is complete or the battery is low, where it can recharge and prepare for the next flight.
